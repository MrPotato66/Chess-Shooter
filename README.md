# Chess-Shooter
A version of Chess classic game with new pieces, with epic shootings as if it was a Narcos episode.

There will be 2 players, each one trying to kill the opposite's King. There are many kinds of pieces: heavy shooters, strong Squires, fast reapers and obviously our leading king. The game will advance by turns: the 2 players make their moves and once both of them have decided what to do then the game goes on.
